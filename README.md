# coupon-acceptance-prediction
Drivers who regularly frequent bars (more than once a month), especially those over the age of 25 and without children as passengers, are significantly more likely to accept bar coupons, indicating that established bar-going habits and a specific adult-oriented social lifestyle are strong predictors of bar coupon acceptance.



Explanation of supporting observations:
  
  1. Strongest Driver: Bar Frequency: The most compelling evidence is the dramatic increase in acceptance from 37.07% (3 or fewer visits/month) to 76.88% (more than 3 visits/month). This suggests that people who already incorporate bars into their routine are highly receptive.
  2. Age and Bar Frequency: The acceptance jumps to 69.52% for drivers who go to bars more than once a month AND are over 25, significantly higher than the general "all others" group at 33.50%. This reinforces the idea that an older, established bar-going demographic is key.
  3. Passenger and Occupation Influence: The group of frequent bar-goers with non-kid passengers and specific occupations shows an even higher acceptance rate of 71.32%, further segmenting this highly receptive demographic. This hints at social context (going with friends/partners, not family) and potentially disposable income/leisure time associated with certain occupations.
  Complex Target Group: While the broader "target group" with multiple OR conditions still shows a higher acceptance (60.54% vs 54.31%), the more specific, highly defined segments focusing on frequent bar visits show the most substantial differences.


Actionable items/recommendations: 
  1. Target bar coupons towards customers who regularly visit bars, especially those over 25 and without children as passengers 
  2. Consider different coupon strategies for different coupon types based on customer demographics and habits.
